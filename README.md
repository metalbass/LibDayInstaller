This project aims to remake the 1998 original Liberation Day from Interactive Magic. The game is an isometric turn-based startegy title, the sequel of Fallen Haven.

For this remake, we aim to use the assets from the original game, so they are extracted through an extractor tool, before they can be used by the game code.

C# is the main language of this project, since the extractor tool is coded in C# win forms and the game is going to run over the Unity engine.

## Documentation
Documentation for both extractor tool and the game project have their own pages here:
- [Extractor tool](Docs/ExtractorTool.md)
- [Game project](Docs/GameProject.md)

## Colaborating
So far, this is a one man project, but I'd love to change that :)
