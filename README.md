## Project status

The project has been abandoned, but it's left here if somebody wants to know how the extraction of assets was done.

This project aimed to remake the 1998 original Liberation Day from Interactive Magic. The game is an isometric turn-based startegy title, the sequel of Fallen Haven.

The only part that was being worked on was this installer, that extracts the assets from the original game. You can see how [here](Docs/ExtractorTool.md)

For a breakdown of what's working and what's not:

| Progress | Task                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 60%      | Reverse engineer assets              |
| 33%      | Export assets to comfortable formats |
| 5%       | Extract with reasonable time         |
| 10%      | Interface and error handling         |
| 0%       | Pack as an installer                 |
